        <p>
            Global warming remains one of the world's most urgent and complex problems. Rising temperatures across the planet are causing glaciers to melt, sea levels to rise, and unpredictable weather patterns to emerge. Experts agree that immediate action is required to prevent irreversible damage to our environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The effects of global warming can be seen in numerous ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased frequency of heatwaves and wildfires</li>
            <li>Stronger storms, hurricanes, and floods</li>
            <li>Ocean acidification and declining wildlife populations</li>
            <li>Threats to agriculture, water supply, and public health</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Governments, businesses, and individuals around the world are working together on solutions. These efforts include shifting to renewable energy sources, reducing carbon emissions, planting trees, and promoting sustainable lifestyles.
        </p>
        <p>
            "If we act now, we can still shape a safer, healthier, and more sustainable future," says Dr. Maya Sanchez, a leading climate scientist. Many countries have pledged to meet ambitious carbon reduction targets and invest in innovative green technologies.

            Everyone has a role in fighting global warming. Simple actions like conserving energy, recycling, and supporting environmental causes can make a difference. As awareness grows, more people are joining the movement to protect our planet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The journey to a cooler Earth will not be easy, but with cooperation and determination, positive change is possible.
